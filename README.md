## Recipe Project<br>
This is my first project from "The Odin Project" curriculum<br>
<br>
This project was done to test my first abilities from the first lessons. 
<br>
<br>
Started using only HTML, a base page was developed together with some other pages with the recipes.
<br>
After, simple CSS was used to change a few viewing things on the page, such as fonts, colors and backgrounds.
